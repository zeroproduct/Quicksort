# Quicksort

In this project, I implemented the simplest Quicksort algorithm and utilized two different select algorithms.
The first pivot was found by selecting the last element in the list, while the second one was found by using the Median of Medians method, which put the list into groups of 5s, found the median of those subgroups, then used the kth (middle) largest element as the pivot.
